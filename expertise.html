    <h2>Music Production</h2>
    We wouldn't be a recording studio without a team that was well versed in production. We
    <br>
    have decades of combined experience with recording, editing, mixing, and mastering.

    <h2>Musical Knowledge</h2>
    Everyone on our team, regardless of their role within the company, has an extensive
    <br> background in music. Our combined skills give us knowledge over multitudes of genres,
    <br> instruments, and performance styles.

    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    Some studios may help you create a stellar product, but you're on your own from there. Not us.
    <br> We want to make sure that you get the exposure you deserve for your talent, so we won't 
    <br> leave you out to dry after your tracks are finalized. Our marketing team has expertise in 
    <br> tactics to elevate your social media, online, and streaming presence so that you can 
    <br> share your music with the world.

    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
    Every recorded piece is special. It means something important to you in some shape or form.
    <br> We can help memorialize that importance by tailoring artwork exactly to your liking.
    <br> Whether that's personalized album art, cover designs, or advertising material, we're
    <br> here to make sure you have exceptional visuals to accompany your music.
